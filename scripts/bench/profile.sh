#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# profile.sh — profile ONLY the measured statements of a single language-test
# bench with `samply`, skipping the dataset import + warmup.
#
# How: the bench harness prints `__BENCH_MEASURE_START__` on stderr (when
# `BENCH_MARKERS=1`) just before the timed loop. This script launches the bench,
# waits for that marker — so the 100k-row import and warmup have finished — then
# attaches `samply record -p <pid>` for the measured region only. The resulting
# flamegraph is the query under test, not the setup.
#
# Why samply: it samples without `sudo` on macOS and Linux (`cargo flamegraph`
# uses `dtrace`, which is SIP-restricted on macOS).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bench/profile.sh <bench-filter> [--backend mem] [--quick] [--dataset NAME] [--out-dir DIR]
#
#   <bench-filter>  Substring matched against the bench file path. Must select
#                   exactly one bench. For a matrix scan that runs both dataset
#                   variants, pass `--dataset <name>` so there is a single import
#                   and a single measured region (otherwise the second variant's
#                   import would be sampled too).
#
# Output (default dir: language-tests/target/bench-profile):
#   <slug>.json.gz   samply profile — view with: samply load <file>
#
# Build profile: `profiling` (release + line-tables-only debug, unstripped,
# panic=unwind, thin-LTO). Requires `samply` (installed on first use).
